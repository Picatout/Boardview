<center><h1>Introduction</h1></center>
<p>
  Proto-layout is a software to draw solderless prototyping board layout. These layouts can be saved as <b>*.pro</b> which are editables or as as bitmap files.
  The bitmap file can be used to communicate the design to orders.  For exemple a teacher can give those to his students to save time in laboratory as 
  students won't have to figure out their own design. This is not a replacement for schematics design but a complement as students must learn to read 
  electronic schematics as well as doing their own.
</P>
<p>
  Proto-layout is so simple an obvious to use this manual is very brief.

<center><h2>Menus navigation</h2></center>
<h4>File menu</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Prototyping board...</b>  This let you select the prototyping board size.  Shortcut key: <b>p</b></li>
<li><b>Open...</b>  This let you open a previously saved  proto-layout ".pro" file for further editing.  Shortcut key: <b>o</b></li>
<li><b>Save...</b>  This let you save your proto-layout design as a ".pro" file that can be re-open for further editing.  Shortcut key: <b>s</b></li>
<li><b>Save as...</b>  Let you save your design under a new name.</li>
<li><b>Save to bitmap...</b> Let you save your design as a bitmap file. That file can be edited in proto-layout</li>
<li><b>Quit</b>  Leave the application.
</uL>
<h4>Edit</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Undo</b>  Undo the last change. Shortcut key: &lt;CTRL&gt;-z</li>
<li><b>Redo</b>  Cancel the last undo. Shortcu key: &lt;CTRL&gt;-r</li>
</ul>
<h4>Jumper</h4>
<p>
  Items in this menu let you choose jumper (wire) color. There is 6 predefined colors but you can also customize your own set of colors. 
  The shortcut key: <b>j</b> display the color chooser dialog box.
</p>
<h4>Add</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>component...</b>  open the electronic components selector dialog. Components are grouped in categories.  Components are represented as
bitmap files, you can add component to database, this is explained below. Shortcut key: <b>c</b></li>
<li><b>tag...</b> Shortcut key: <b>t</b>. open the <b>tag</b> dialog box.  This let you add text to identify component. After you have placed a tag over a component this tag
follow the component, provided you drag the component by clicking over the tag. The font, size and color of tag are all selectable.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Help</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>manual...</b> Open this manual in default web browser. Shorcut key: <b>F1</b></li>
<li><b>about...</b> display the about dialog box.</li>
</ul>
<center><h2>toolbar</h2></center>
<p>
  The toolbar present the most used menu items as icons. Placing the mouse over an icon will display the corresponding tip. Each element of toolbar 
  as a shorcut key as presented in above paragraph.
</p>
<center><h2>Placing elements on the board</h2></center>
<p>
 When the mouse is moved over the board, its coordinates are displayed on the left of status bar. When the mouse is over a hole a small circle appear
 around that hole. When this append you can press down the left mouse button and drag the mouse over another hole and release it. This will place a
 jumper between the 2 holes. This jumper as the current selected color. You can change the color of an already placed jumper by right clicking on it
  and selecting <b>color...</b> of the popup context menu.
</p>
<p>
  To place an electronic component click the corresponding icon on the toolbar or press <b>c</b> key to open <b>component selection</b> dialog box. 
  Select the category then the component and click <b>Ok</b> button. The component will appear just under the toolbar on the left side. Drag the component
  on the board where you want to place it.   
</p>  
<p>
  To add a tag click the <b>tag</b> icon on the toolbar or press <b>t</b> key to open the <b>tag</b> dialog box. 
  The <b>font</b> button in the dialog open a font dialog.  Tag, like components, appears under the toolbar at left and must be dragged on
  the prototyping board. 
</p>
<p>
  Elements are drawned on the board in the order they are created. If you add a component and place it over a tag, this one will become 
  invisible. But there is an item in the popup context menu place it on top. Right click on the component and select <b>place on top</b>.
</p>
<h4>Adding component to the library</h4>
<p>
  In the application directory there is a file named <b>proto-layout.cmp</b>. This is the component library file. This is a text file that can be open in any text editor. The file is 
  formatted as an <a href="http://openeuphoria.org">euphoria language object</a>. It is a good idea to make a copy before editing it. If you don't understand,
  the format don't edit it.  But if you understand it, you can add new board size, new component categories, and new components. 
  The file is read a program startup. If you modify it while the program is running you must restart proto-layout for the update to take effect.
</p>
<h4>component bitmap</h4>
<p>
  When you create a component bitmap. Don't use pure <b>BLACK</b> (RGB value 0x000000) as a color. Proto-layout use pure black as target points for prototyping 
  board hole center. This is how it knows where to place jumper terminations. To fake pure black create a custom color with RGB value 0x010101. If you draw a new prototyping board use pure black only where there should be jumper termination.  
  <br/>Proto-layout expect bitmaps to be placed in <b>resources</b> sub-directory of the application directory.
