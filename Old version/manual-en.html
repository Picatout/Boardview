<center><h1>Introduction</h1></center>
<p>
  BoardView is a software to draw solderless prototyping board layout. These layouts can be saved as <b>*.brd</b> files which are editables or as bitmap files.
  The bitmap file can be used to communicate the design to others.

<p>
  The toolbar present the most used menu items as icons. Placing the mouse over an icon will display the corresponding tip in a balloon. Each element of toolbar 
  as a shorcut key as presented above.
<div><image src="file:resources/docs/en/toolbar.png"/></div>  
</p>
<center><h2>statusbar</h2></center>
<div><image src="file:resources/docs/en/statusbar.png"/></div>
<p>
  The statusbar at lower windows  is divided in 2 sections. Left section display information about elements placed on the board.
  <h4>elements types</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Components</b> are electronic component making the circuit.</li>
<li><b>Jumpers</b> are wires that connect components togethers to form the circuit.</li>
<li><b>Tags</b> are short texts used to identify components or give others indications.</li>
<li><b>Links</b> are wires like jumpers but used to connect out of board components to the board tie points. A Link is embedded in the 
component object it is connected to.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  The right section of status bar display information about current operation or tie point hit.
</p>
<center><h2>Placing elements on the board</h2></center>
<h4>Context menu</h4>
<div><image src="file:resources/docs/en/context-menu.png"/></div>
<p>
   The contextual menu pop up when right clicking on the board or around it. It comprise the following items.
  <ul>
  <hr width="10%" align="left"/>
  <li><b>Add component...</b>  Select a component and place it where you clicked to popup the menu.</li>
  <hr width="10%" align="left"/>
  <li><b>Add tag...</b> Define ne new tag and place it where you clicked to popup the menu.  if you click over a component the tag will be 
  centered on that component and embedded in it.</li>
  <hr width="10%" align="left"/>
  <li><b>Modify...</b> This item let you modify a tag properties.</li>
  <hr width="10%" align="left"/>
  <li><b>Color...</b> This item let you change a jumper or link color.</li>
  <hr width="10%" align="left"/>
  <li><b>Delete</b>  This item let you delete the clicked element.</li>
  <hr width="10%" align="left"/>
  <li><b>Color fill...</b> This item is active when the mouse cursor is right clicked over a fill zone an let you colorize that zone.</li>
  <hr width="10%" align="left"/>
  <li><b>Resistor Value...</b> this item is active when the mouse cursor is right clicked over a resistor component. It Open the resistor value dialog.
  <div><image src="file:resources/docs/en/resistor-dialog.png"/></div> 
  </li>  
  <hr width="10%" align="left"/>
  <li><b>Rotate 90d</b>  This item and the following 2 let you rotate the component.This is 90 degrees clockwise rotation.</li>  
  <hr width="10%" align="left"/>
  <li><b>Rotate 180d</b>  Rotate 180 degrees.</li>
  <hr width="10%" align="left"/>
  <li><b>Rotate -90d</b>  Rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
 When the mouse is over a tie point a small circle appear around it and the right section of statusbar indicate if it is a board tie point 
 or component tie point.  At that position you can press down the left mouse button and drag the mouse over
 another tie point and release it. This will place a  jumper between the 2 tie points. This jumper has the current selected color. You can change the 
 color of an already placed jumper by right clicking on it and selecting <b>color...</b> item in the popup context menu.  
 You can grab any end of a jumper to drag it at another tie point. You can also grab it in the 
  middle to stretch it like a rubber band. The stretch will stay when you release the mouse button.</br>
  Links does not work like jumpers. They must be placed by starting at component tie point toward the board tie point. The opposite result in a jumper placing.
  Jumpers and links have differents properties. Links can't be stretched. Links follow the component when it is moved around, not so for jumpers. 
  To delete a link you must rigth click at its tie point on component. Same to change its color.
  </p>
<p>
  You can place a component on the prototyping board 4 ways:
  <ol>
  <li>Selecting <b>component...</b> from <b>Add</b> menu.</li>
  <li>using the shortcut key: <b>c</b></li>
  <li>clicking component icon on the toolbar</li>
  <li>right-clicking and choosing <b>Add component...</b> from the popup menu.</li>
  </ol>
  Either way this open <b>component selection</b> dialog box.
  <div><image src="file:resources/docs/en/component-selection.png"/></div>  
  Select the category then the component and click <b>Ok</b> button. For the first 3 ways, the component will appear just under the toolbar on the left side.
  Drag the component on the board where you want to place it.  But if you choose the fourth way, the component will be placed where you right-clicked on 
  the board, This do for faster component placement.
</p> 
<p>
  Components that are not designed to be plugged in a solderless prototyping board can be placed outside of it. Increase windows size to make place around the 
  board then place such a component aside the board. Then link it to board with wires. Start links at the component tie point and terminate them at board
  tie point. A circle appear when the mouse cursor is over a component connexion point to indicate that the mouse button can be released. Tracing a jumper from 
  the board toward the component result in a jumper instead of a  link.
</p> 
<p>
  <b>Tags</b> can be added 4 ways too with the same result as component placement. 
  <div><image src="file:resources/docs/en/tag-dialog.png"/></div>
  In tag dialog box, the <b>font</b> button open a font dialog.  Tags, like components, appears under the toolbar at left and must be dragged on
  the prototyping board. You can also place them by right-clicking on the board.  If you right click on a component to add a tag to it the text will be centered 
on component area and become part of it. Erasing the component erase the tag.  This is different from dragging a tag over a component, in that case the 
tag stay independant of the component and will not move with it nor be erased with the component.  
</p>
<p>
  Elements are drawned on the board in the order they are created. If you drag a more recently added element over an other one it mask the older one.
</p>
<p>
  The board can be dragged around in the application windows. All installed elements move with the board.
</p>
<h4>Cloning component and tag</h4>
<p>
  A component or a tag can be cloned by holding down &lt;CTRL&gt; key before pressing left mouse button on the component or tag, then dragging the clone at
  desired place. This is a fast way to place many identicals components on the prototyping board.
</p>
<h4>Adding components to the library</h4>
<div><image src="file:resources/docs/en/library-dialog.png"/></div>
<p>
  from the <b>Add</b> menu click on <b>components library...</b> to open the dialog box. From this dialog you can manage categories and components. Selecting a
  category and clicking the <b>delete</b> button under the category listbox will delete that category and all its components. A warning message is displayed before
  proceeding.
</p>
<p>
  Adding a category is as simple as typing its name in the <b>new category</b> field and clicking <b>accept</b> button. The new category will appear at the 
  end of the list.
</p>
<p>
  To add a component to a category, first select the category, then type the component name in <b>new component</b> field.  Components are displayed as bitmaps,
  so you must specify the bitmap file for that component before clicking <b>accept</b> button. The new component will be added at end of list.
</p>
<p>
  When the library dialog is closed categories and components names are alphabetically sorted.
</p>
<h4>component bitmap</h4>
<p>
  When you create a component bitmap. Don't use <a href="#special_colors">special color</a> <b>BLACK 1</b>  (RGB value 0x010101) as a color except at connexion points. 
  BoardView use that color as target point for prototyping board tie point center. This is how it knows where to place jumper termination.  
  <b>WHITE</b> (RGB 0xFFFFFF) may also cause a problem as it is the transparent color. This color should appear only as bitmap background. 
  If other parts of the bitmap have WHITE, use the special color <b>WHITE -2</b> RGB 0xFEFEFE.<br/> 
  Other point to consider is that the prototyping boards distributed with BoardView
  have a tie point grid of 10 pixels. When you draw components with visible tie points, to fit nicely on the board those must be spaced a multiple of 10 pixels. 
  Look at DIL-*.BMP for exemples.  

  </p>
<h4>fill zone</h4>
<p>
 There is another <a href="#special_colors">special color</a> <b>BLACK 2</b> which is used for fill zones. If you create a bitmap with zones filled with that 
 color the user will be able to colorize those zones right clicking on it and using the <i>color fill</i> item of context menu.
</p>
<p>
<a name="#special_colors"></a>
<table border="single">
 <th colspan="3">special colors</th>
 <tr><td><b>color</b></td><td><b>R,G,B</br>composition</b></td><td><b>use</b></td></tr>
 <tr><td>BLACK 1</td><td>01,01,01</td><td>tie point</td></tr>
 <tr><td>BLACK 2</td><td>02,02,02</td><td>fill zone</td></tr>
 <tr><td>WHITE</td><td>255,255,255</td><td>transparent color</td></tr>
 <tr><td>WHITE -2</td><td>254,254,254</td><td>visible white</td></tr>
 </table>
</p>
<h4>Resistor component</h4>
<p>
  The 4 bands resistor bitmap distributed with BoardView is designed with special information embedded in 4 corners pixels. These pixels contain the coordinates
  of the center of each fill zone for the color code bands. BoardView use this information to colorize the resistor according with the value selected in the
  <i>resistor value</i> dialog.<div><image src="file:resources/docs/en/resistor-dialog.png"/></div></br>
  To enter the value in the dialog choose the color in the 4 lists. When the 4 lists have an item selected the resulting values are displayed in the edits 
  fields below the lists.  Click <b>Ok</b> to accept the values.  
</p>
<p>
  To conclude ont that subject, BoardView expect bitmaps to be placed in <b>resources</b> sub-directory of the application directory.  If you add a component which bitmap is not in
   that directory, it will be asked if the bitmap file should be copied there.
   </p>
<h4>Advanced library editing</h4>
<p>
  The library information is stored in application directory as <i>BoardView.cmp</i>. This file can  be opened in text editor and modified by hand.
  One should be carefull before doing it. It is safer to make a backup of the file.  This file is an <a href="http://openeuphoria.org">euphoria object</a>.
  If after hand editing it no more respect euphoria object syntax il will become unusable and break the functionnality of BoardView.
  It is at your own risk.
