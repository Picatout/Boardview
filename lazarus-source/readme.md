# Boardview Lazarus/Free pascal

The original source code of Boardview written in Open Euphoria was lost so I deccided to recreate the application using a more commun development tool namely Lazarus/Free pascal.
The development was done on a Windows 10 laptop but it should be compileable on a linux system althougth I didn't test yet.

This version doesn't replicate exactly the behavior of the original version but does essentially the same.
